# Project 1 Generative Text

Olivia Benson, obenson2@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

The idea for this project was to take descriptions from humane society adoption sites and have the computer generate its own descriptions of cats. I could then draw these new versions of cats. 

## Model/Data

I trained this model on a compilation of descriptions of cats from the site https://www.petfinder.com/ 
Along with the description, I included Name, Age, Size, and Color/Pattern.

## Code

## Results

The final results are made of a compilation of my favorite outputs generated by the program. Some of the requirements I used to choose these outputs included: Full cohesive paragraphs, an actual name provided for a cat, resemblance in tone structure of the original text, and most importantly, humor. If they made me laugh, they were chosen. 

To generate these results, I played with the prefix and found starting with a name worked best to generate resembling results. The temperature and length could all be adjusted to get varying outputs with success as long as the prefix started it off right.
