# Project 1 Generative Text

Olivia Benson, obenson2@huskers.unl.edu


## Abstract

I have two ideas. 

Idea 1: Take cats/dogs from humane societies and to create names and blurbs about them. There are many creative and fun names out there these days. I would them make cute little illustrations about the pets up for adoption. 

Idea 2: Makeup tutorials. And then trying them out on myself. I have a very very limited skill with makeup so this could be fun, however could prove hard to find written instructions.
