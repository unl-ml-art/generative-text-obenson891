## Abstract

I have two ideas. bee bee boo boo

Idea 1: Take cats/dogs from humane societies and to create names and blurbs about them. There are many creative and fun names out there these days. I would them make cute little illustrations about the pets up for adoption.

## Code

Your code for generating your project:

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 
- describe what you've done, such as changing prompt or temperature and results
