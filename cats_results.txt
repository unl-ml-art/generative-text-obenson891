Lovey-Weasel is a 1 year old female green-eyed tabby (lady-in-arms), tabby (lady-litterator), and friend (lover) of both men and dogs. She is a super fun girl cat who always has a laugh and is a big hit when she's in the mood to chill out. She is friendly and sociable with other cats and will often play with her sister Arlo and brother Kenny when they are not home. She is a low energy girl who the overprotective cat owner will have to coax gently back into her cage. She eagerly awaits her day off and will be sure to warm to the touch if given the opportunity. If you ever have the opportunity to catch her before she heads into the sun, give her a lap or two while she refrains from getting too hot, then watch her glide away. She will enter the sunniest parts of the day brighter than ever and we can only imagine what a difference that makes her time apart from you will make. For her sister Arlo, time apart can mean up to a week off per year if taken as prescribed. For her brother Kenny, it can mean up to a month off per year.
