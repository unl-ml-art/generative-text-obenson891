Crystal
Little Blue
Young  Female  Medium  Tabby (Orange / Red)
Hi there, I'm Crystal! I'm a 2-year old blue-eyed blue-haired girl here to tell you a little bit about me. I came to us when I was still in the purr line, so I am still purring. I was originally going to be a toy kitten, but I was a little shy once I came to us. Now that I am here, everyone is super into me. I have tons of love in my heart for my humans and they are definitely making me happier than ever.

Shelly

Young adult
Kitten
Shelly is a 5-month old kitten that I adopted from the Feral Cat Society three years ago. She was a very shy cat who would only come out to people she knew by heart. After meeting and having a pet with Shelly for a few weeks, I knew she was made for a home. She's a sweet, affectionate cat who never once bit me in her life. She's very friendly and friendly dogs are always welcome, but she really needs a home with a solid home with a good owner who can love her there all the time.
