And if only it wasn't the nostalgia that's making me so excited! After all, the year is 2000, so it might have been a good time for me to get a little nostalgic. I mean, I had all my favorite anime growing up, right?\n",

      "Hi Adam. I'm Rachel. I'm a 1 to 5 year old. I'm quite playful. Unfortunately, I'm also quite shy. When I'm around other people, I can be a bit shy. Please don't be discouraged if I'm a little shy around new people. I just like meeting new people and having a good time. I also enjoy being pet, scratched, cuddled, cuddly, etc. I actually like being called names a lot. I have a little boy's voice and a little girl's voice. I'm pretty spectrum-active. I fall somewhere on the spectrum between being completely normal, and being extremely rare. I'm mostly talked-about here in Columbus, Ohio, and other areas of eastern North America. I'm not very sociable, and if I am, it's usually to other humans. If you happen to see me, or have a conversation about me, it generally goes something like this: \"Hey, what's up?\" \"Yep, I saw you around the corner!\" Or, \"Hey, I saw you walking by my spot a while back!\" Or, \"Hey, how ya doing, what's up?\" \"I'm fine, just a little nervous\", or \"Hey, how are you doing, what's up?\" \"I'm really happy to see you, how ya doing?\" \"Ok, so what's going on?\" \"I just saw you for the first time. I froze up for a second, but then I just started laughing!\" So, that's pretty cool. \"Cool, what's the matter?\" \"I just saw you for the first time, and I was really surprised! I was so freaked out! I thought maybe you were watching me and recording me?!\" \"Oh my, no, I wasn't! I was so happy! I just wanted to sit and watch you! I thought maybe you were going to leave!\" \"Oh my, that\n",
